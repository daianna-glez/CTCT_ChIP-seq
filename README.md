# CTCT_ChIP-seq
CTCF binding sites co-localized with other TFBS motifs

## Description
This work obtains CTCF binding sites motifs with **RSAT** tools and use them to identify co-localized TFBS.

## Motivation
To gain insights into CTCF interactions with other TFs in breast cancer cells through an
approach based on identifying TFs that co-occupy CTCF binding sites in the MCF-7 breast cell line based
not directly on ChIP-seq identified sites but on motifs of those sequences that present similarity and high
correlation with other known TFBS motifs.
